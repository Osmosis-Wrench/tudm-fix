changelog v4.8
 - BUGFIX: Using stepdodge in first person would trigger both stepdodge and roll stamina loss, essentially doubling the cost. Fixed, with a toggle to turn off this fix in the MCM in case the slight extra processing time causes you issues.
 - CHANGE: Explicit support for Alternate Perspective by Scrab. If you have any issues with this fix, please report them to me.
 - CHANGE: Replaced armor unequip messagebox with console notification. Special thanks to Fuzzles for the PR.

changelog v4.6

changelog v4.5
 - BUGFIX: Sneaking while in crafting menu would break crosshair. Fixed.
 - BUGFIX: I was checking races in a stupid way which prevented vampires from being able to dodge. Fixed by explicitly checking if player is currently Vampire Lord race or Werewolf Beast race, this will hopefully also ensure better compatibility with race mods in general.
